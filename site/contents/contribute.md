# How to contribute

The Data Hazards project is always welcoming new contributors!
Here are some things we particuarly invite your input on:

- Adding new safety pre-cautions to existing Hazards  
- Adding new resources to the Hazards to help people mitigate them  
- Adding new examples the Hazards

We would also love to hear from you if you:

- Have general feedback on the way the Hazards work together or individually. This could be the way they are worded or the range of topics that they cover.
- Want to contribute materials to help other people use the Hazards, or have examples to share of how you have used them. 

Below are some guides on how to contribute to the project.
