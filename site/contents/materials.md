# How to use

On this page you will find materials we have made to help people to use or apply the hazards. 
This includes a workshop format, a teaching/lecture based format, and an asychronous format which can be adapted to just be an individual exercise.
We are currently developing all these materials so please do get in touch with us through the 'Contact' tab above if you have any thoughts or examples of how you have used the materials! 

All of these activities are based around the [Data Hazard labels](data-hazards). 

## Workshop format

## Teaching/Lecture format

For the teaching format there is a summary page for the students that has some links to be used during a lecture. 
There is also a page for teachers that can be used to help plan a lesson which includes suggested timings and the overview of the activity.
