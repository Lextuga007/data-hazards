# Teaching

The Data Hazard labels make a great resource for teaching, and this has been a popular use for them so far. 
This page contains information that might be useful if you are planning to include the Data Hazards in your teaching, and is based on student seminars that we delivered at the University of Bristol. 
The format is generally aimed at undergraduate STEM students in a seminar, but could easily be adapted to suit the context.
At the sidebar you will also find an example of the prompt page we gave to students to guide them through the session. 

The Data Hazards resources have also been used for undergraduate and masters students studying data storytelling, digital health and data science at other institutions.

## Ethos and background 

If you are teaching the Data Hazards, please keep in mind the ethos that they were intended to be used with. 
The Data Hazards are built on the foundations of standpoint theory. 
This is an epistemiological theory that knowledge (including in the sciences) is not objective, and that our perspectives are shaped by our lived socio-political experiences. 
This means that ethical problems are not going to have a single correct answer, and that to get a well-rounded understanding of the ethical issues of any new technology we need people from lots of different standpoints to analyse it from their perspective. 
This is the best way we can understand the harms it could possibly cause.
We also need to make sure that we are paying attention to how technology might be more likely to adversely affect people from minoritised backgrounds.

In summary, the Data Hazards exist to prompt discussion, reflection and thought. 
They are not a checkbox exercise, and there is no requirement for a group to come to a consensus. 
We hope that the Data Hazards discussion and reflective activities will help students be aware of a broader variety of potential ethical risks in tech projects, and that ethics is complex, situational and worth discussing in their future roles. 

## Format

This teaching example is adapted from the general Data Hazards Workshop format, which is used by those who want feedback on specific research ideas. 
Here we keep the reflective discussion format of the workshop, but suggest the lecturer comes up with a case study to suit their students.  

We suggest starting with a 10-15 minute presentation to introduce the Data Hazards to the students, along with the reasoning of why they exist. 
The lecturer should then present a case study that the students can discuss in small groups.
Prior to the discussion, students should have the opportunity to ask clarifying questions about the project. 

## Timings

17:00 - 17:05 - Settling in  
17:05 - 17:15 - Background presentation (see link to slides below)
17:15 - 17:20 - Time to get into small groups  
     17:20 - 17:25 - Case study presentation by lecturer  
     17:25 - 17:30 - Small group discussions, with lecturer walking around the groups to assist
     17:30 - 17:45 - Larger group feedback, identifying trends and voting on Hazards  
17:45 - 17:50 - Wrap up  

## Preparation Required

### Case Study

The teaching team should have a case study prepared that suits the background and level of their students.  
The case study should be about a specific application of data science to a problem. 
To be clear, this could be anything from simple statistical analysis or creation of a dataset, all the way to a highly complex neural network design - it all depends on your students. 

We recommend you include as many of the following details in any case study description as they'll help students to apply the Hazards:
- The purpose of the research, e.g. what problem the research is solving if any?
- What data is used and how that was collected
- What kinds of methodology are used (e.g. stats, algorithms, machine learning).
- Who is involved in the research, e.g researchers, communities, sponsors?
- Potential applications/routes to impact


### Interactive questions
We used [slido](https://www.sli.do/) to ask questions to the entire group about their application of the Data Hazards.
This requires a few minutes of setup.
Alternatively, the questions could equally be done by a show of hands, in which case you might want to focus your attention on 1-3 relevant Hazard labels.

We usually ask:
- Following the discussion, which Hazards do you think apply to the case study? (Multiple choices: choose as many as you like)
- Did you change your mind about which Hazards applied during the discussion? (Yes/No)
- What have you taken away from the group discussion?

## Slides

You can find the slides we have used to present the background information about the Data Hazards [at this link]((https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1KzTdvnL8wk9oZ-h7C_yNWHtA4ki5i6moij8y-gP-z0s/edit?usp=sharing)). There is also a preview of the slides below.

## Tell us you used these resources
If you used these resources in your teaching, you are under no obligation to do so, but we would be so pleased if you could send us a [brief email](grp-ethicaldatascience@groups.bristol.ac.uk) to let us know.
We'd love to hear what case study you used and how the students reacted, and if there's anything we could do to make these resources easier to use.
